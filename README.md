# ConnectedOFP
This is a simple webapp that pulls your latest Simbrief OFP once you have entered your simbrief ID or username.
Once the ofp has been retrieved you can create a fuel plan, select your fuel alternate and add discretionary fuel. You can also keep track of your OOOI times (Out, Off, On, In).

With your actual departure fuel and the Off time entered you can then use the navlog page to keep track off the flights progress and fuel burn. A good way to monitor for fuel leaks or see if you're gaining or losing time.
